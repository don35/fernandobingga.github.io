            <p class="post__details-date text-sm">December 16, 2022</p><br>

            <p class="post__details text-lg">
                Cleaning is a word generally met with some displease, however, its results are always good, whether it is in regards to hygiene, or… code! Writing clean code is one of the most important targets a front end developer can set their sights on, as not only it allows them to write better, but also paves the way for less writing.
                Tips and practices for writing clean code are countless, which can be overwhelming at times, especially for junior software engineers and developers.
                Every single minute spent studying and experimenting on how to write clean code, is a minute well-spent. Not only does it allow the developer to create code faster and more efficiently, but it helps with three very important aspects of any business.<br><br>
                <b>HOW TO START WRITING CLEAN CODE</b>
                After presenting the three pillars that support the clean code philosophy, it is time to check out a few tips on how to write clean code. Writing clean code is as simple as writing code, with a few tweaks and fine-tuning to optimize the final result.
                Even one or two of these tips can prove fundamental to how clean a code can be, and developers should consider following as many as they see fit, tailoring them to how they like to write code.<br></br>
                <b>Functions & Methods: Divide and conquer</b>
                This is one of the most important tips a developer, and especially a new developer can practice. Making sure that each function or method performs only one task allows software engineers to name their functions and methods in a cleaner way so that other developers could understand what they do.  
                More importantly, functions become more predictable, producing the same output when given the same inputs. Robert C. Martin introduced this practice as one of his five object-oriented design principles known as SOLID. It is called the “Single Responsibility Principle”.<br></br>

                <p class="post__details text-lg">
                <b>Commenting makes things clear</b>
                Regardless of how simple a developer makes their functions, variables, and methods, some lines of code require explanation. Software engineers should not be afraid to add comments, to clarify things found in their code.
                Comments give perspective and explain the purpose of something a developer wrote in their code, while also providing insight on what a code might need to become even better.<br></br>

                <b>Consistency is vital</b>
                Whether you are a fron end developer or not, you must have noticed that when you find a practice that you like and that works, you stick to it. The same applies to writing clean code. Consistency in your practices is vital not only for your code to be clean, but for you to set up a coding “framework”, and for others to understand that approach.
                A great way to understand why developing a coding principle is important is to read our blog on Design Systems, and how companies set rules that allow them to bring forth consistent services and/or products.<br></br>
